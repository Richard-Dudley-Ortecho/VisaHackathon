Project: Merchant'mon Go

In a socially distanced world, small businesses discovery rates are at an all time low. Our solution, Merchant’mon Go, is an interactive game that puts you onto the streets outside your house looking for the next best deals, all from the comfort of your phone or computer. Leveraging Google Maps’ and Visas’ APIs, Merchant’mon Go allows you to explore Small Business Merchants virtually and view detailed information about each merchant. Furthermore, small business owners can develop their own online presence via our game by registering their business so customers can visit them in-game. We hope to “gamify” the discount hunting experience as well with a rewards system based on how many unique merchants are visited each day. So come download Merchant'mon Go! Gotta discover them all!
